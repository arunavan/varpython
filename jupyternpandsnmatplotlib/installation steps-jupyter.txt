Benefits of Markdown for Earth Data Science
Being able to include both Markdown and code (e.g. Python) cells in a Jupyter
 Notebook file supports reproducible science by allowing you to:

Document your workflow: You can add text to the document that describes the steps 
of your processing workflow (e.g. how data is being processed and what results are 
produced).

Describe your data: You can describe the data that you are using (e.g. source, 
pre-processing, metadata).
Interpret code outputs: You can add some text that interprets or discusses the 
outputs.
